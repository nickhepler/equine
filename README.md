## Objectives ##
The main objective of this project was to utilise the `R` language and environment for statistical computing and graphics to obtain a raw data set, prepare the raw data for analysis, and run an analysis of the data, provide a visualisation of the data, and to create a report document with `LaTeX` documentation format.

## Results Reproduction ##
The results in this report can be reproduced using the following procedure:

Download the following files to your `R` working directory:

*   [download_data.R](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nickhepler/equine/master/download_data.R)
*   [data_preparation.R](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nickhepler/equine/master/data_preparation.R)
*   [run_analysis.R](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nickhepler/equine/master/run_analysis.R)

Source the _download_data.R_ file in one of the following manners:

*   From the `R` command line type: `source("download_data.R")`
*   From the Linux/Mac terminal type: `R CMD BATCH download_data.R` from your `R` working director.

## Technical Specifications ##
