## Objectives ##
This project examines summary statistics concerning *Equine Death and Breakdown* data obtained from the New York State Gaming Commission. The data contains information on every horse that has broken down, died, sustained a serious injury, or been involved in an incident at a track in New York State since 2009.

The objective of the author was to utilize the `R` language and environment for statistical computing and graphics to create a reproducible research project. The project employed the `ggplot2` package to create data visualizations along with [R Markdown]( http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) to generate the final report.

## Results Reproduction ##
The results in this report can be reproduced using the following procedure:

Download the following files to your `R` working directory:

*   [download_data.R](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nickhepler/equine/master/download_data.R)
*   [data_preparation.R](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nickhepler/equine/master/data_preparation.R)
*   [run_analysis.R](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nickhepler/equine/master/run_analysis.R)

Source the _download_data.R_ file in one of the following manners:

*   From the `R` command line type: `source("download_data.R")`
*   From the Linux/Mac terminal type: `R CMD BATCH download_data.R` from your `R` working director.
